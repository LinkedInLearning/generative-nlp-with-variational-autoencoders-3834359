There’s so much going on in the world of AI right now that it can seem impossible to feel like you’re on track. This is especially true for models that generate text. Which ones should you use, how should you use them, and when?

In this course, join instructor Axel Sirota as he offers an in-depth overview of variational autoencoders (VAEs) specifically focused on how to create complex models in Keras, how to create denoising autoencoders, and how to create VAEs for text generation. Throughout the course, Alex provides hands-on demonstrations and exercise challenges to test out your new skills.
